# 🧠 Smart Voice Assistant with Machine Learning

A full-featured voice assistant built using Python, Flask, and Machine Learning models.  
It can listen, understand, and respond intelligently using:
- Speech Recognition (Wav2Vec2)
- Intent Classification (TF-IDF + Logistic Regression)
- Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- Text-to-Speech (pyttsx3)
- Web-based Interface
